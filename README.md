# Marketing Dashboard

This marketing dashboard is a tool that every start up needs. It allows startup businesses to :
<ul>
  <li>View all users/customers</li>
  <li>Send personalized emails, messages to users/customers in specific groups</li>
  <li>Add, edit, and delete users/customers</li>
  <li>Add marketing list</li></ul>
  
The dashboard utilizes APIs to help manage user/customer data on a single platform. More APIs can be added to the dashboard, it just depends on the startups needs.

I followed Anaia Kubow's tutorial, but have made several changes to make it my own. This project is currently underconstruction and will be completed 7.8.22.
